Gudhi stands for "Geometry Understanding in Higher Dimensions".

For those curious about the word "Gudhi", it is a part of the name of a spring
festival called [Gudhi Padwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudi_Padwa)
that takes place in certain parts of India (in particular, the province of
Maharashtra) to celebrate the new year.

The Padwa part in the name refers to the first day of every two weeks in a
lunar month.
The Gudhi part refers to a banner topped by a bright colorful silk cloth and a 
a garland of leaves and flowers, that is often erected on the main door of
houses, symbolizing a victory or an achievement.
