The Gudhi library is a generic open source C++ library for Computational Topology and Topological Data Analysis ([TDA][1]).
The GUDHI library is developed as part of the [GUDHI project][2] supported by the European Research Council. The GUDHI library intends to help the development of new algorithmic solutions in TDA and their transfer to applications. It provides robust, efficient, flexible and easy to use implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures.

The current release of the GUDHI library includes:

- Data structures to represent, construct and manipulate simplicial complexes.
- Algorithms to compute persistent homology and multi-field persistent homology.
- Simplication of simplicial complexes by edge contraction.

All data-structures are generic and several of their aspects can be parameterized via template classes. We refer to [this document][3] for a detailed description of the design of the library.

The library comes with data sets, demos, examples and test suites.
