GUDHI has been started thanks to a five years project (2014-2019) supported by an Advanced
Investigator Grant of the [European Research Council][1] and hosted by [INRIA][2].

[INRIA][2] is supporting actively the GUDHI library development from the beginning.

A collaboration with the [Ecole Centrale de Nantes][3] and the [Laboratoire de Math√©matiques Jean Leray][4]
in Nantes (LMJL) is supporting the development effort as well as the data sciences aspects of the library.
