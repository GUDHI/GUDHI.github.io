The GUDHI library uses C++14 and requires [Boost](https://www.boost.org).

Some of GUDHI examples require the [Computational Geometry Algorithms Library](https://www.cgal.org) (CGAL).

For Python developpers, a [Python interface]({{ site.officialurl }}/python/latest/) is available.

For R developpers, be aware that some of GUDHI modules are also accessible though the [R package TDA](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDA) (Statistical Tools for Topological Data Analysis) and through the [R package rgudhi](https://lmjl-alea.github.io/rgudhi/).
