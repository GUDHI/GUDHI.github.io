The GUDHI library uses c++11 and requires [Boost][1].

Some of GUDHI examples require the [Computational Geometry Algorithms Library][2] (CGAL).

For Python developpers, a [Cython interface][4] is available.

For R developpers, be aware that some of GUDHI modules are also accessible though the [R package TDA][3] (Statistical Tools for Topological Data Analysis).
