The GUDHI library is a generic open source [C++ library][2], with a [Python interface][3], for Topological Data Analysis ([TDA][1]) and Higher Dimensional Geometry Understanding. The library offers state-of-the-art data structures and algorithms to construct simplicial complexes and compute persistent homology.

The library comes with data sets, demos, examples and test suites.
