The GUDHI library is a generic open source [C++ library][4], with a [Python interface][5], for Topological Data Analysis ([TDA][1]) and Higher Dimensional Geometry Understanding. The library offers state-of-the-art data structures and algorithms to construct simplicial complexes and compute persistent homology.

The library comes with data sets, demos, examples and test suites.

The GUDHI library is developed as part of the [GUDHI project][2] supported by the [European Research Council][3].
