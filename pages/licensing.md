The GUDHI library is a C++ library, with a Python interface (via Cython). It is available under a [MIT][1] license.

### Third-party libraries license

Some of the GUDHI modules depend on third-party libraries that are under a [GPLv3][2] license ([CGAL][3], [Miniball][4]).
In the documentation "Copyright: MIT (GPL v3)" in the package list stands for exactly the situation described: GUDHI code is MIT, but there is a dependency on GPL code, so for practical purposes for a user it is as if this package was [GPLv3][2].

[GPLv3][2] is a Copyleft license that gives the user the right to use, copy and modify the code freely for non-commercial purposes.

Note that any [GPLv3][2]-derived modules must be distributed under the [GPLv3][2] license.

For a commercial license, do not hesitate to contact them.
