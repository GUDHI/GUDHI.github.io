## Alpha complex ##
[Alpha complex][1] utilities compute Alpha complex persistence from a point cloud.

For more design information, please refer to the [Alpha complex design documentation][2].


## Bottleneck distance ##
An utility computes [Bottleneck distance][3] between 2 persistence diagrams.

For more design information, please refer to the [Bottleneck distance design documentation][4].

# Čech complex #
[Čech complex][15] utilities compute Čech complex persistence from a point cloud.

For more design information, please refer to the [Čech complex design documentation][16].

## Cover complex ##
[Cover complex][5] utilities compute Nerve or the Voronoi Graph Induced Complex.

For more design information, please refer to the [Cover complex design documentation][6].


## Cubical Complex ##
[Cubical complex][7] utilities compute Cubical (periodic or non-periodic) complex persistence from a [Perseus file style][9].

For more design information, please refer to the [Cubical complex design documentation][8].


## Rips Complex ##
[Rips complex][10] utilities compute Rips complex persistence from a point cloud and a distance function, or from a distance matrix.

For more design information, please refer to the [Rips complex design documentation][11].


## Witness complex ##
[Witness complex][12] utilities compute Witness complex persistence from a point cloud. A weak and a strong version are available.

For more design information, please refer to the [Witness complex design documentation][13].


## Miscellaneous ##
An [OFF point set generator][14] utility is also available.
