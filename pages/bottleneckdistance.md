## bottleneck_read_file_example ##

This program computes the Bottleneck distance between two persistence diagram files.

**Usage**

```
   bottleneck_read_file_example <file_1.pers> <file_2.pers> [<tolerance>]
```

where

* `<file_1.pers>` and `<file_2.pers>` must be in the format described [here](http://gudhi.gforge.inria.fr/doc/latest/fileformats.html#FileFormatsPers).
* `<tolerance>` is an error bound on the bottleneck distance (set by default to the smallest positive double value).
