We are pleased to announce the release of [rgudhi](https://lmjl-alea.github.io/rgudhi/) and its availability on CRAN.

[rgudhi](https://lmjl-alea.github.io/rgudhi/) is an R interface to the Python package GUDHI.
We are greatful to Aymeric Stamm for this great achievement that was possible thanks to our collaboration
with the [Ecole Centrale de Nantes](http://www.ec-nantes.fr/) and the
[Laboratoire de Math√©matiques Jean Leray](https://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr) in Nantes (LMJL).

Do not hesitate to test this new interface and [send your feedbacks](https://github.com/lmjl-alea/rgudhi/issues).
