We are pleased to announce the release 3.8.0rc1 of the GUDHI library.

As a major new feature, the GUDHI library now offers Perslay, a Tensorflow model for the representations module, scikit-learn like interfaces for Cover Complexes, a new function to compute persistence of a function on ℝ and the possibility to build a Cubical Complex as a lower-star filtration from vertices.

We are now using GitHub to develop the GUDHI library, do not hesitate to [fork the GUDHI project on GitHub](https://github.com/GUDHI/gudhi-devel). From a user point of view, we recommend to download GUDHI user version (gudhi.3.X.X.tar.gz).

Below is a list of changes made since GUDHI 3.7.1:

- [Perslay](https://gudhi.inria.fr/python/latest/representations_tflow_itf_ref.html)
     - a TensorFlow layer for persistence diagrams representations.

- [Cover Complex](https://gudhi.inria.fr/python/latest/cover_complex_sklearn_user.html)
     - New classes to compute Mapper, Graph Induced complex and Nerves with a scikit-learn like interface.

- [Persistent cohomology](https://gudhi.inria.fr/doc/latest/group__persistent__cohomology.html)
     - New linear-time `compute_persistence_of_function_on_line`, also available though `CubicalPersistence` in Python.

- [Cubical complex](https://gudhi.inria.fr/doc/latest/group__cubical__complex.html)
     - Add possibility to build a lower-star filtration from vertices instead of top-dimensional cubes.
     - Naming the arguments is now mandatory in CubicalComplex python constructor.
     - Remove `newshape` mechanism from [CubicalPersistence](https://gudhi.inria.fr/python/latest/cubical_complex_sklearn_itf_ref.html)

- [Hera version of Wasserstein distance](https://gudhi.inria.fr/python/latest/wasserstein_distance_user.html#hera)
     - now provides matching in its interface.

- [Subsampling](https://gudhi.inria.fr/doc/latest/group__subsampling.html)
     - New `choose_n_farthest_points_metric` as a faster alternative of `choose_n_farthest_points`.

- [SimplexTree](https://gudhi.inria.fr/python/latest/simplex_tree_ref.html)
     - `SimplexTree` can now be used with `pickle`.
     - new `prune_above_dimension` method.

- Installation
     - CMake 3.8 is the new minimal standard to compile the library.
     - Support for oneAPI TBB (instead of deprecated TBB) to take advantage of multicore performance.

- [Python documentation](https://gudhi.inria.fr/python/latest/installation.html)
     - [pydata-sphinx-theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the new sphinx theme of the python documentation.

- Miscellaneous
     - The [list of bugs that were solved since GUDHI-3.7.1](https://github.com/GUDHI/gudhi-devel/issues?q=label%3A3.8.0+is%3Aclosed) is available on GitHub.
