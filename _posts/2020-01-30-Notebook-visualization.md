Here is a notebook that explains how to visualize an alpha-complex thanks to
[Matplotlib tri-surface](https://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/tutorial.html#tri-surface-plots).

If you prefer dynamic visualization, the second example, that uses
[plotly 3D mesh plots](https://plot.ly/python/3d-mesh/) and
[ipywidget slider](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20List.html).

Other examples are available
[here](https://gudhi.inria.fr/python/latest/_downloads/16cb4e6746ab0a6e8e9034624f89c895/plot_simplex_tree_dim012.py)
(including another technique with [Mayavi](https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/index.html))
