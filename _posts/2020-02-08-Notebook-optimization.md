You might have already seen a few examples of persistence diagram computations on point clouds.
Among the different possibilities, the Rips filtration is the most common option due to its simplicity and easy implementation.
In this notebook, we will see how Gudhi and
[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) can be combined to perform optimization of persistence diagrams.
