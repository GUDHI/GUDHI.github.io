Below is a list of changes made since Gudhi 1.3.0:

- Bug fix

As Simplex_handle default type was an 'int' in the simplex tree data structure, persistence cohomology computation was segmentation faulting
when the number of simplices was going further to the 'int' maximum value (2.7 billions of simplices on a classical modern machine and OS).
Simplex_handle default type is now an 'std::uint32_t' and can go up to about 4 billions of simplices.

- CMake

     - The messages from CMake has been rewritten to be more consistent.

- Coding conventions

     - CMake projects names and C++ namespaces have been homogenized.

- Documentation

     - Mandatory and optional third party libraries have been separated in the documentation.

- Data sets

     - in data/points/generator : thanks to [Aur√©lien Alvarez][5], aurelien_alvarez_surfaces_in_R8.py is a script to generate
     points on a surface in R8.
