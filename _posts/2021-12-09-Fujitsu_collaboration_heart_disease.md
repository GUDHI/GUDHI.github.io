Four years into their collaboration, artificial intelligence technology developed by Japan’s Fujitsu and Inria’s
DataShape project-team is being tested in a major clinical trial. The technology leverages Topological Data Analysis
(TDA) to automatically create AI models that can detect anomalies in time-series data in fields such as health or
engineering. In October, the Fujitsu AI team and the cardiology team at the University of Tokyo Hospital began
evaluating its potential for early detection of heart disease.
